<h2 id="2-course-description">2. Course Description<a class="anchorjs-link " aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>

<p>This course will provide an introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) concepts and software. It is intended for undergraduate planning students but open to other undergraduates.

  The course introduces the concepts of GIS as well as practical training on ESRI's ArcGIS suite. Students successfully completing the course will have general familiarity with the major functionality of ArcGIS but will also be introduced at a basic level to other desktop GIS packages as well as web GIS applications.</p>

<h2 id="21-topics">2.1 Topics<a class="anchorjs-link " aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h2>

<p>The course will cover at a basic level the three most common use cases of GIS – digital cartography, spatial analysis, and spatial data management. Additionally, students should be able to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use geospatial data to create a digital map with good cartographic style which conveys the intended information clearly and accurately;</li>
  <li>Understand common geospatial data formats, including types of vector data, and what kinds of phenomena are appropriate for each type. Understand the concept of geographic scale;</li>
  <li>Deal with data that are in different projections and coordinate systems, as well as fix basic problems with the definition of those coordinate systems. Understand which projections are appropriate for which kinds of maps or analysis;</li>
  <li>Integrate data based on location and attributes. Perform basic spatial analyses such as buffer, overlay, intersection, spatial join, and point-in-polygon analysis;</li>
  <li>Understand the basics of using US Census Bureau data, including how blocks, block groups, and tracts are organized, what information is available at each level, and how to find those data;</li>
  <li>Think critically about spatial data and digital maps, including understanding types of error and interpreting commonly produced maps;</li>
  <li>Create, edit, merge, and manage spatial data layers at a basic level of competency.</li>
</ol>

<p>The course will combine lecture and hands-on activities. Students will need to plan on having regular access to a copy of ArcGIS 10 by using a local installation or accessing campus computing resources. Course grades are based on completion of software training modules, one exam, two short projects, and in small part a series of weekly quizzes.</p>

<p>It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website for information on this process and to apply for services online: <a href="http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>

<h3 id="53-discrimination-and-power-based-violence">5.3 Discrimination and power-based violence<a class="anchorjs-link "  aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important</p>

<ol>
  <li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>

<p>As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">Just Report It portal</a>. <strong>The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="54-religious-accommodations">5.4 Religious accommodations<a class="anchorjs-link " aria-label="Anchor" data-anchorjs-icon="" style="font: 1em / 1 anchorjs-icons; padding-left: 0.375em;"></a></h3>

<p>It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>

<p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me via Email (<em>zhiqiu@virginia.edu</em>) as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <em>UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</em> or 434-924-3200.</p>
